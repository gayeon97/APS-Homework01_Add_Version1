***
IIn mathematics Fibonacci numbers are the the sequence of numbers such that each value is the sum of the two
preceding values starting with the first two values.

fib1 = 0

fib2 = 1

(Yes, there are some definitions that start with a pair: 1, 1, but for the purpose of this problem we will use the above
starting values.)

Your task is to compute the N’th Fibonacci number given the number N.


**Input**

The first and only line of input contains the number N (1 <= N <= 80).

**Output**

The output contains the value of the N’th Fibonacci number followed by a newline character.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
1

Output:
0
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
4

Output:
2
```
